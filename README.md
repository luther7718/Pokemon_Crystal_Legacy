This is a repo for my own edits to [TheSmithPlays's](https://www.youtube.com/@smithplayspokemon) wonderful Pokemon Crystal romhack.

## Changes:
* Further streamlined all mandatory tutorial text in the spirit of Crystal Legacy
* Edited text added in Crystal Legacy to be closer to the quality and formatting of the vanilla game
* Elaborated on optional tutorial text to give more information to any first-time Pokemon players who happen to play this hack
* Fixed typos, grammatical errors, and formatting inconsistencies both from Legacy and Vanilla
* Minor script changes, such as:
    * Route 29 trainer now uses previously unused text about waiting for daytime
    * Cherrygrove Rival fight now has different win/lose text, these were also swapped around in the original disassembly
    * Exp. Share now given by Prof. Oak instead of Mr. Pokemon
    * Second Exp. Share (in vanilla location, in exchange for the Red Scale) has been replaced with the Scope Lens (formerly only available via Mystery Gift)

## To-do:
* Continue with text edits. Currently all gyms and main game up to Violet City complete
* Give access to all items and decorations locked behind Mystery Gift (since you can get all 251 Pokemon in Legacy, all items should be available too)
    * All decorations will be bought by Mom using the money saving system
    * All items will be available either from catching/Thief'ing wild pokemon or as rewards during the main quest
